String slicing and Operations of String

len() : find the length of a string using len() function.
String as an array : A string is essentially a sequence of characters also called an array. Thus we can access the elements of this array.
slicing : This method of specifying the start and end index to specify a part of a string is called slicing.
          Eg. print(pie[0:5]) (0 to n-1)
Loop through a String : Strings are arrays and arrays are iterable. Thus we can loop through strings.
