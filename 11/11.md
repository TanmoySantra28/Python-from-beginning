# Introduction to Loops

 When we need to execute a group of statements a certain number of times. This can be done using loops.

 ## Two types

 1) for loop
 2) while loop

## for Loop

for loops can iterate over a sequence of iterable objects in python. 
"Iterating over a sequence" means iterating over strings, lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries.

## Example: 

### iterating over a string:

``` bash
name = 'tanmoy'
for i in name:
    print(i, end=", ")
```

### terating over a list:

``` bash
l1 = ["Cat","Cow","Dog"]
for x in l1:
    print(x)
```

## range()

if we do not want to iterate over a sequence, and we want to use for loop for a specific number of times, we use range().

Syntax: range(start, stop, steps)

``` bash
for k in range(5):
    print(k)
```
