# While loops

While loops execute statements while the condition is True. As soon as the condition becomes False, the interpreter comes out of the while loop.

## Else with While Loop

As soon as the while loop condition becomes False, the interpreter comes out of the while loop and the else statement is executed.

## Do-While loop in python

do..while is a loop in which a set of instructions will execute at least once (irrespective of the condition) and then the repetition of loop's body will depend on the condition passed at the end of the while loop. It is not supported in Python. But, we can emulate it in python.

For example, using a infinite loop with break statement.
