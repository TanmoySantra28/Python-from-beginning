# If Else Conditional Statement

### Conditional operators

<, >, >=, <=, ==, !=
These Conditional operators returns boolean (true or false)

``` bash
a=18
print(a>18)
print(a<=18)
print(a==18)
print(a!=18)
```
Output
``` bash
False
True
True
False
```
## The conditional statements are further classified into following types:

1) if
2) if-else
3) if-else-elif
4) nested if-else-elif

## if Statement

There is no else part

## if-else Statements

When we want to evaluate only one condition.

### if the expression evaluates True:
Execute the block of code inside if statement. After execution return to the code out of the if……else block.

### if the expression evaluates False:
Execute the block of code inside else statement. After execution return to the code out of the if……else block.

## elif Statements

When we want to evaluate more than one condition.

1. Execute the block of code inside if statement if the initial expression isTrue.

2. Execute the block of code inside the first elif statement if the expression inside it is True. 

3. Execute the block of code inside the second elif statement if the expression inside it is True.

## Nested if statements

We can use if, if-else, elif statements inside other if statements.
